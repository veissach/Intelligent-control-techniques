# Intelligent control techniques for Robots

In this work I analyze the performances of different intelligent control algorithms, applied to trajectory tracking on a 2R and 3R robotic manipulator, whose dynamical parameters and structure are unknown. I developed and compared a genetic neurocontroller, two main Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Q-Learning and Actor-Critic), and a neural network with trigonometric basis functions that learns the inverse dynamics by error back-propagation.
